#WHAT IS GitHub?
GitHub is a Git repository hosting service that provides a web-based graphical interface. It is the worldâ€™s largest coding community. 
Putting a code or a project into GitHub brings it increased, widespread exposure. Programmers can find source codes in many different languages and use 
the command-line interface, Git, to make and keep track of any changes.
In short GitHub provides a platform that helps every team member work together on a project from any location while facilitating collaboration


#FEATURES OF GitHub
1. Easy Project Management
GitHub is a place where project managers and developers come together to coordinate, track, and update their work so that projects are transparent and stay on 
schedule.
2. Increased Safety With Packages
Packages can be published privately, within the team, or publicly to the open-source community. The packages can be used or reused by downloading them from 
GitHub.
3. Effective Team Management
GitHub helps all the team members stay on the same page and organized. Moderation tools like Issue and Pull Request Locking help the team to focus on the 
code.
4. Improved Code Writing
Pull requests help the organizations to review, develop, and propose new code. Team members can discuss any implementations and proposals through these 
before changing the source code.
5. Increased Code Safety
GitHub uses dedicated tools to identify and analyze vulnerabilities to the code that other tools tend to miss. Development teams everywhere work together to 
secure the software supply chain, from start to finish.
6. Easy Code Hosting
All the code and documentation are in one place. There are millions of repositories on GitHub, and each repository has its own tools to help you host and release 
code.
